# FlappyBird-like simple game
This is a little project made on p5Web with Javascript. This was done as I finished some introductory programming Alura courses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To play the game, paste these files in the **p5Web editor** and hit play or Ctrl+Enter to start

Press the **Up** and **Down** **arrow keys** to move the bird and avoid the obstacles.

If you reach **10 points**, you win!

Have fun!
